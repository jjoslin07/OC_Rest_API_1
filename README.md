# Go-Fullstack Project OC
### [Go Full-Stack With Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Course (Project 6 Web Developer Course)](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5614116-go-full-stack-with-node-js-express-and-mongodb)

### Synopsis

Is JavaScript still just a front-end language? Not anymore! With **MongoDB, Express,** and **Node**, you can take your JavaScript ninja skills to the back end!

Starting with Node and Express, you will discover how **web apps** work on the back end. You will create different **routes** for the different functions you want to make available in your API. Then you will add MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to make your API fully dynamic and your data fully persistent.

Many courses of this kind push you into some kind of front-end framework like Angular, React, or Vue. In this course, however, the front-end app is already built! This means that you can fully concentrate on building your API and watch it come to life, honing your back-end skills and leaving you free to choose your own path.

The app you will be working on is a very simple online store. You will build an API to **CRUD** (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete) items for sale. You will add **authentication** to your API to protect it, and you will also incorporate **user file handling** to allow users to upload images.

#### Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- create a basic Express web server
- use Mongoose to access a MongoDB database in an Express app
- create a RESTful web API using Node, Express, and MongoDB
- protect selected routes with token-based authentication in an Express app
- handle user files in an Express app

#### Course prerequisites

In order to succeed in this course, you will need to already have a good understanding of the Web's **client-server relationship**, as well as a working knowledge of **JavaScript, HTTP/AJAX,** and **Git**. You can acquire these skills by taking the following courses and their prerequisites:  

- **Write JavaScript for the Web**
- **Manage and deploy your project with Git & Github**

**Tools required :**

- a code editor
- Node
- Angular CLI
